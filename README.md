### Fashion Project
In this project the model will make predictions across three fashion categories: Glasses, Jeans, and Shoes.

_Issue:_ E-commerce fashion website is dedicated to selling clothes. Unfortunately, many users upload a picture of their products without including any labels, leading to a significant problem. For instance, customers encounter difficulties when searching for specific items, resulting in them being unable to find what they are looking for and potentially turning to alternative websites for their purchases.

_Resolution:_ Develop a Deep Learning model to automatically assign labels to the clothing items, addressing the labeling issue and enhancing the customer experience.
